# HandwritingRecognition
Build a model to recognise the handwriting

Goals: 
	1. To recognise handwriting from an image using neural network model
	Input: Image containing handwritten letters (in some form) 
	Output: Letters
	
    Open question could be:  Can we recognise the handwriting from the video? (or live camera)
    
    
    
Steps: 
	1. Neural Network performing on MNIST dataset with somewhat high accuracy1
	(until 

	2. Neural Network recognizing numbers and letters using some given data
	
	3. Reading/creating own data, i.e. creating input function, using an external camera, do image processing to seperate letters

Risks:
	Accuracy
	Setting Goals too high
	Availability of training sets
	Copying existing solutions instead of creating an own one
