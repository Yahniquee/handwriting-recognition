    Intro to the project (some words about goal and result expected)   
    
    Example 
    
   1. Data(preprocessing part) (Ismail)
             explain the shapes or stuff we ecountered
              during the coding part
   
    
     2. Architecture:  (Alban)
 why we choosed cnn(better for image classification)
why didn't we use svm               
           
             
    3. Training: (Julius, Alban)
    Explain the cnn architecture and the layers
       explain the dropout layer
       explain the accuracy and validation accuracy(with the graphs)
       when does overvftting occurs?
       why does cross-validation helps with the overfitting problem
     giving some "classification report" to look fancier
       
       
       
    
    4.   Input function:(Jannik)
    explain the part of splitting the letters in one image
   (Jannik, Ismail)
explain the difference between models that we trained and their accuracy
    
(Jannik shows implementation
probably Ismail to)
5. Final product

(Alban, Julius, Jannik, Ismail):
6. Lessons learned/what can be improved?
(Julius)
7. Who did what
