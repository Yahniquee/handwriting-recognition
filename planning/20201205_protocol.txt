To prepare for the meeting, make sure that you have selected a project
manager. Moreover, you should have started and ideally completed the first
project phase "Initiation". Make sure that you have worked out and written
down the goals of the project (not only the goals of the client but also of
the group itself) as well as possible steps, risks and open questions.
You might have already started with the second phase "Planning". Let me
again stress that this phase is very important and you should take it
serious. I expect you to work out and write down a project plan including
all tasks/milesones/time frames before you start with the third phase
"Execution".
Finally, let me point out that communication within the group including
feedback (positive and negative) is very important for the success of the
project and should be included into the project plan.

    
Goals: 
	1. To recognise handwriting from an image using neural network model
	Input: Image containing handwritten letters (in some form) 
	Output: Letters
	
    Open question could be:  Can we recognise the handwriting from the video? (or live camera)
    
    
    
Steps: 
	1. Neural Network performing on MNIST dataset with somewhat high accuracy1
	(until 

	2. Neural Network recognizing numbers and letters using some given data
	
	3. Reading/creating own data, i.e. creating input function, using an external camera, do image processing to seperate letters
	
	4 FINAL 15.07.2020 
    
Risks:
	Accuracy
	Setting Goals too high
	Availability of training sets
	Copying existing solutions instead of creating an own one
